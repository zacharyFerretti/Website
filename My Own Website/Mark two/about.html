 <p>This is me. And those are my sunglasses, Sunday Drive. I am a Junior Computer Science student, currently studying out of Edinburgh Scotland.  
 	I have been a photographer for a little bit under three years, during which time I have travelled 
 	to more places than I ever thought I would. 
 	<br/><br/> This is my first website that I have fully programmed myself. I have made it all using CSS, HTML, Javascript, and JQuery. If you have
 	any questions about the programming of the website feel free to reach out to me at zf66728@gmail.com.
 	Alternatively you can check my github <a href = "https://github.com/zacharyFerretti">here</a>. The current working code is under the website repository, in the folder 'Mark Two'.
